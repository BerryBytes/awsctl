## Project Maintainer Responsibilities

Maintainers will:

2. Address violations promptly and fairly
3. Remove harmful content or contributors if needed

## Scope

Applies to all project spaces:

- GitHub repositories, issues, PRs
- Community forums (e.g., Discord, Slack)
- Interactions when representing awsctl (e.g., conferences)

### **Enforcement Guidelines**

1. **First Instance:**

   - The message is edited and marked as "abuse."
   - Content added:
     > "Dear user, we want AWSCTL to provide a welcoming and respectful environment. Your [comment/issue/PR] has been reported and marked as abuse according to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Thank you."

2. **Second Instance:**

   - The message is again edited and marked as "abuse."
   - Results in a **7-day ban**.

3. **Third Instance:**
   - The message is edited and marked as "abuse."
   - Results in a **permanent ban**.

All enforcement actions are discussed among maintainers beforehand to ensure fairness. Reports must be resolved following the [GitHub Reporting Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/managing-reported-content-in-your-organizations-repository#resolving-a-report).
