## Overview

`awsctl` is a CLI tool designed to simplify AWS environment access and resource management using AWS Single Sign-On (SSO). It provides interactive commands to configure profiles, SSH/SSM into bastion hosts, manage RDS connections, update EKS configurations, and login to ECR.

AWS CLI leverages the powerful [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) framework to build a robust and user-friendly command-line interface.

## Requirements

### System Requirements

- **OS**:
  - Linux (Kernel 4.17+)
  - macOS (10.13+)
  - Windows ( limited support )
- **Architecture**: x86_64 or ARM64

**Notes**:

- You need an AWS account with SSO enabled and appropriate permissions to configure SSO profiles.
- Installation commands like `sudo apt install -y kubectl` or `sudo apt install -y docker.io` are Ubuntu-specific. For other systems (e.g., macOS, Windows, or other Linux distributions), refer to the linked installation guides.
- The `ssh` (OpenSSH client) is typically pre-installed on Linux and macOS. If not, install it on Debian-based systems with `sudo apt install -y openssh-client` or use the equivalent for your OS.

## Features

- **SSO Authentication**: Log in and manage AWS SSO profiles with a single command, ensuring secure access to AWS resources.

- **Bastion/EC2 SSH Access**: Connect to bastion hosts or EC2 instances via SSH or SSM with automated session setup.

- **Port Forwarding & SOCKS Proxy**: Access internal AWS resources securely using dynamic port forwarding or a SOCKS5 proxy for flexible networking.

- **RDS Connectivity**: Connect to RDS databases directly or via SSH/SSM tunnels, supporting both direct endpoints and secure tunneling.

- **EKS Cluster Management**: Update your local kubeconfig to access Amazon EKS clusters in seconds, simplifying Kubernetes workflows.

- **ECR Authentication**: Authenticate to Amazon ECR with SSO credentials to securely push and pull container images.

## Installation

### Releases

- Check out the latest releases at [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/berrybytes/awsctl/releases).
  You can also install the awsctl using following command.

1. To install the latest version.

```
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/berrybytes/awsctl/develop/installer.sh | bash
```

2. To install specific version (e.g: `v0.0.1`)

```
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/berrybytes/awsctl/develop/installer.sh | bash -s -- v0.0.1
```

### Manual

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:BerryBytes/awsctl.git
```

2. Make the `install-awsctl.sh` executable:

```bash
chmod +x install-awsctl.sh
```

3. Run the startup script:

- #### First Time Installation
  If this is your first time installing, use the `source` command:

```bash
source ./install-awsctl.sh
```

This ensures environment changes (like `PATH` updates) take effect immediately.

### Why use `source`?

- Executes in current shell session
- Updates environment variables immediately
- No terminal restart required

### For Updates

Run normally:

```bash
./install-awsctl.sh
```

### Usage

Start with `awsctl --help` OR `awsctl -h` to get started.

### Configuration File

- The `awsctl sso setup` command checks for a configuration file at `~/.config/awsctl/` (supported formats: `config.json`, `config.yml`, or `config.yaml`). If none exists, new configuration will be setup.

- Below is sample `config.yaml` file in:

```yaml
ssoSessions:
  - name: "sso-session-1"
    startUrl: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    region: "XX-XXXX-X"
  - name: "sso-session-2"
    startUrl: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    region: "XX-XXXX-X"
    scopes: "sso:account:access"
```

**Note**: `scopes` can be empty. Default value will be `sso:account:access`

### Commands

The following table summarizes the available `awsctl` commands:

| Command            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `awsctl sso setup` | Creates or updates an AWS SSO profile. If a config file is available at `~/.config/awsctl/`, it will be used; otherwise, you will be prompted to enter the SSO Start URL and Region. The selected profile is then set as the default and authenticated. |
| `awsctl sso init`  | Starts SSO authentication by allowing you to select from existing AWS SSO profiles (created via `awsctl sso setup`). Useful for switching between multiple configured SSO profiles.                                                                     |
| `awsctl bastion`   | Manages SSH/SSM connections, SOCKS proxy, or port forwarding to bastion hosts or EC2 instances.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `awsctl rds`       | Connects to RDS databases directly or via SSH/SSM tunnels.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `awsctl eks`       | Updates kubeconfig for accessing Amazon EKS clusters.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
